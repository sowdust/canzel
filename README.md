Canzel is a web application thought to regularly monitor entries in robots.txt files, and provide a way to easily navigate visualize and navigate them.

When a new entry in a monitored robots.txt file is found, if it is currently online (i.e. status code 2**), a screenshot is taken and it is archived on the Wayback Machine.

An example istance is used to monitor the robots.txt files of some major European online newspapers to track articles that are being de-indexed.
