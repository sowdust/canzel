Canzel is a web application thought to regularly monitor entries in robots.txt files, and provide a way to easily navigate visualize and navigate them.

When a new entry in a monitored robots.txt file is found, if it is currently online (i.e. status code 2\*\*), a screenshot is taken and it is archived on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/).

An example istance is used to monitor the robots.txt files of the main italian online newspapers; a [twitter bot account](https://twitter.com/canzelbot) lets you know when a new entry is found.
